## Audit Preparation Checklist

**Identify the Audit Scope:** [x]  
- Determine the specific areas of the codebase that will be audited. [x]  
- Identify any dependencies that should be included in the audit. [x]

**Gather Documentation:** [ ]  
- Collect all relevant documents (e.g., whitepapers, technical specifications, architectural diagrams). [ ]  
- Ensure documentation is comprehensive, up-to-date, and accessible to the auditors. [ ]

**Provide Access to the Codebase:** [ ]  
- Grant access to the complete smart contract codebase, including all relevant files and dependencies. [x]  
- Host the code in a secure repository to allow safe auditor access. [x]

**Share Deployment Information:** [ ]  
- Provide details of any deployed contracts, including:  
  - Contract addresses [ ]  
  - Transaction hashes [ ]  
  - Information on available dApps for interacting with the components [ ]  
- If deployed on a testnet, share the relevant deployment details. [ ]

**Share Test Cases:** [ ]  
- Provide any internal test cases and security assessment results. [ ]  
- Include any identified issues from in-house testing to help focus the audit on critical areas. [ ]

**Communicate with the Auditor:** [ ]

## Audit Requirements Checklist

In addition to the preparation tasks, ensure that the following technical requirements are met prior to the audit:

**Compilation and Testing:** [x]  
- Ensure contracts compile and pass all tests using `cargo test`. [x]  
- Run `cargo fmt` to format the Rust code for consistency and improved readability. [x]  
- Address as many issues as possible reported by `cargo clippy`. [x]

**Test Coverage:** [x]  
- Achieve a minimum of 40% test coverage as reported by `cargo tarpaulin`. [x]

**Dependency Security:** [x]  
- Run `cargo audit`. [x]  
- Ensure that no problematic dependencies are flagged to avoid potential supply chain attacks. [x]

**Code Freeze:** [ ]  
- Ensure the code freeze hash remains unchanged during the audit. [ ]  
- Avoid any new commits or alterations while the audit is in progress. [ ]

**Code Hygiene:** [ ]  
- Remove all unreachable code. [x]  
- Address or remove any leftover `//TODO` comments. [x]  
- Eliminate non-relevant file templates or leftover boilerplate files. [x]
