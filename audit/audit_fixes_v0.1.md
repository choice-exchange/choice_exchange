# Audit fixes

26th April 2025

## 1. Funds Sent for Verifying Native Token Decimals Can Be Stolen 

**Issue Summary:**  
A MODERATE risk was identified where native tokens sent to the `choice_factory` contract (to verify token decimals) could become permanently stuck or exploited during liquidity creation.

**Fix:**  
We introduced a secure withdrawal mechanism that allows only the contract owner to recover accidentally sent native tokens. A new `WithdrawNative` execution message was added, and ownership checks were enforced to ensure only the authorized owner can perform withdrawals.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Access control:** Only the owner can withdraw native tokens, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Limited scope:** Withdrawals are limited to native tokens sent directly to the factory contract; liquidity and user funds in pairs are unaffected.
- **Impact:** No changes to liquidity pool behavior. This fix ensures that tokens mistakenly sent to the factory are safely recoverable and the contract cannot accumulate unclaimed funds.

## 2. Incorrect refund asset event emitted for CW20 tokens

**Summary:**  
In `provide_liquidity`, a `remain_amount` was incorrectly calculated and emitted for CW20 tokens, even though excess sending is impossible.  
We updated the logic to set `remain_amount = 0` for CW20 assets, ensuring that refund events are only emitted when necessary.

**Fix:**  
Added a check to override `remain_amount` to zero for CW20 tokens before pushing to `refund_assets`.

## 3. Addresses and subaccounts are not validated

**Issue Summary:**  
Certain fields in the `choice_send_to_auction` contract (`msg.admin`, `msg.adapter_contract`, and `msg.burn_auction_subaccount`) were not properly validated during instantiation and configuration updates. This could lead to invalid addresses or subaccount values being stored.

**Fix:**  
We added the following validations:
- Used `deps.api.addr_validate` to validate `msg.admin` and `msg.adapter_contract` during contract instantiation.
- Validated `msg.admin` again during configuration updates in `execute_update_config`.
- Used `SubaccountId::new(...)` with error handling to validate the `msg.burn_auction_subaccount` string format during instantiation.

These changes ensure that only properly formatted addresses and subaccount IDs can be stored, improving contract safety and aligning with audit recommendations.

## 4. LP Amount Calculation Fix

**Issue Summary:**  
In the `choice_pair` contract, the `lp_amount` value (representing liquidity provider rewards) was previously calculated as `2/3` of the total fee. Due to integer rounding, this caused minor inconsistencies between the actual distributed amounts and the emitted `pool_amount` event.

**Fix:**  
We updated the `lp_amount` calculation to use the formula:  
`lp_amount = total_fee - fee_wallet_amount - burn_amount`.  
This ensures that `lp_amount` always accurately reflects the remaining amount after subtracting the exact `fee_wallet_amount` and `burn_amount`, avoiding rounding errors and making the emitted `pool_amount` event correct.

## 5. Two-Step Ownership Transfer Implementation

**Issue Summary:**  
Both the `choice_factory` and `choice_send_to_auction` contracts originally allowed ownership to be transferred immediately without confirmation from the new owner. This carried a risk: if the owner mistakenly transferred ownership to an invalid address or an address they did not control, ownership would be permanently lost.

**Fix:**  
We implemented a complete **two-step ownership transfer** mechanism in both contracts:
- The current owner must first call a `ProposeNewOwner` function, specifying the intended new owner.
- The proposed new owner must then call `AcceptOwnership` to finalize and accept the transfer.
- Additionally, the current owner can now call `CancelOwnershipProposal` at any time before acceptance to cancel a pending ownership transfer if it was made in error.

This approach ensures that ownership can only be transferred intentionally and safely, and provides a recovery path if the proposal was incorrect.  
The `UpdateConfig` function was also updated to remove the ability to directly change the owner, fully enforcing the two-step process.

## 6. Misleading error message

**Fix:**  

We updated the error message to `unauthorized: sender does not match owner in denom and is not contract owner`

## 7. â€‹Duplicate message interface

**Issue Summary:**  
The `SendNative` message was duplicated in the `choice_pair` contract through a locally defined `BurnManagerMsg` enum. This local version was incomplete and inconsistent with the standardized `ExecuteMsg` already defined in the shared `packages/choice/src/send_to_auction.rs` module.

**Fix:**  
We removed the duplicate `BurnManagerMsg` definition from the `choice_pair` contract and now directly import and use the standardized `ExecuteMsg` from `choice::send_to_auction`.

## 8. Miscellaneous Code Quality Improvements

**Fix Summary:**  
We implemented all recommended miscellaneous code quality improvements across the contracts, including removing duplicate code, correcting minor typos, optimizing for-loop behavior, reducing unnecessary validation, and simplifying message dispatch logic. These changes improve maintainability, readability, and minor gas efficiency without affecting contract functionality.
